* create trace and analyze
  * `go test -trace trace.out .`
  * `go tool trace trace.out`, navigate to trace and highlight GCs
    * this demo is used to demonstrate creating and debugging concurrency, so there are some issues built into demo!
  
* create trace with more aggressive GC
  * `GOGC=25 go test -trace trace2.out`
  * `go tool trace trace2.out`
  * discuss that GC was running almost continuously to try and keep memory free
* disable GC
  * useful when stop-the-world events need to be tightly controlled
  * `GOGC=off go test -trace trace3.out`
  * `go tool trace trace3.out`
  * notice that program runs MUCH faster but heap allocation is orders of magnitude higher
